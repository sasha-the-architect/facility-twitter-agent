# The Facility + DIGI

**The Complete Creative Economy Ecosystem**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

- Gatekeepers control what gets created
- Artists struggle to fund multimedia projects  
- Distribution is monopolized by big tech
- Investors have no transparency or liquidity

## 💡 The Solution

**Two interconnected platforms:**

### The Facility (Funding Layer)
Crowdfunding multimedia projects through smart contracts.

**How it works:**
- Creators sell % of project to "Facilitators" (investors)
- Milestone-based funding with escrow protection
- Secondary market for trading project ownership
- Creators keep 51%+ to prevent governance deadlock

**Revenue:** 3% transaction fee + 5% project ownership

### DIGI (Distribution Layer)
Decentralized video/audio encoding and delivery.

**How it works:**
- Powered by Livepeer + Audius (no data centers!)
- Micro-transactions (pay per view, NO subscriptions)
- 10% fee (5% encoders, 5% DIGI)
- Token launch ready

## 🔗 The Ecosystem

```
Creator → The Facility (funding) → Milestones → DIGI (distribution) 
     ↑                                              ↓
Facilitators ← Returns ← Revenue ← Users pay credits
```

## 👥 Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Creators** | Sell project %, receive funding, deliver to DIGI |
| **Facilitators** | Invest USD, receive returns, trade on secondary |
| **Encoders** | Provide GPU/compute, earn rewards |
| **Curators** | Review projects, provide expertise |
