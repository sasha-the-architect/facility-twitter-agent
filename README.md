# The Facility + DIGI

**Decentralized Distribution Ecosystem for Filmmakers & Storytellers**

---

## 🎯 The Problem

- **Piracy through downloads** - Current platforms expose content to theft
- **Studio gatekeepers** - Filmmakers need distribution deals to reach audiences
- **Opaque revenue** - Creators don't know what their work earns
- **IP vulnerability** - Centralized servers mean vulnerable content

## 💡 The Solution

**DePIN streaming with full IP protection for narrative storytelling:**

### The Facility (Protection & Advocacy Layer)
Protects filmmakers and ensures fair deals in the entertainment industry.

**How it works:**
- Reviews distribution contracts, flags problematic terms
- Advocates for filmmaker interests
- Connects storytellers with DIGI's decentralized distribution
- Helps projects "graduate" to major distributors when ready

**Purpose:** Filmmakers shouldn't need law degrees to understand their deals.

### DIGI (DePIN Streaming Distribution)
Decentralized streaming with **no downloads** — content streams, files never exposed.

**How it works:**
- DePIN networks (distributed nodes, not central servers)
- Streaming-only delivery — IP never exposed as downloadable files
- On-chain revenue tracking visible to everyone
- Pay-per-view or subscription, creator-controlled

**Key Differentiator:** Piracy is impossible by architecture, not DRM patches.

### The Parent (Negotiation Layer)
When film projects prove their value on DIGI, The Parent uses on-chain data to pitch major distributors.

**How it works:**
- Tracks revenue velocity on-chain
- Demonstrates real audience demand
- Uses data as leverage for better deals
- Filmmakers get better terms, distributors get proven projects

## 🎬 What We Do

**The Facility is a decentralized distribution ecosystem specifically for:**

| Content Type | Delivery Method |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Narrative films | DePIN streaming |
| Short films | No downloads - streaming only |
| Television shows | IP-protected distribution |
| Documentary content | Secure video delivery |
| Visual storytelling | Decentralized infrastructure |

**What we DON'T do:**
- ❌ Music distribution (separate IP protection needed)
- ❌ Direct downloads (exposes content to piracy)
- ❌ Centralized servers (single point of failure)

           Audiences (stream content, never download)
                ↓
        Revenue tracked on-chain (transparent)
                ↓
      The Parent (uses data to pitch distributors)
                ↓
   Major distributors (Netflix, studios - better deals)
```

## 🎥 For Filmmakers

### Why The Facility?

1. **IP Protection** - Content streams, never downloads. Your film stays yours.
2. **Fair Deals** - We review contracts, advocate for you
3. **Transparent Revenue** - On-chain tracking, no hidden numbers
4. **Direct Access** - No studio gatekeepers between you and your audience
5. **Data Leverage** - Revenue velocity proves your project's worth

### The Graduation Process

A film "graduates" from DIGI when:
- ✅ Returned 100% to all contributors
- ✅ Paid 20% profit to contributors
- ✅ Demonstrated real revenue velocity on-chain

Then The Parent uses that data to pitch major distributors — real leverage based on real performance.

Files stored centrally    →    Distributed across DePIN nodes
Downloads available       →    Streaming ONLY - no downloads
One server breach         →    No single point of failure
Piracy easy               →    Piracy architecturally impossible
