## Rate Limits & Safety Thresholds

| Method | Actions/Min | Actions/Hour | Daily Max | Best For |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Bird CLI | 1-2 | 10-15 | 50 | Likes, follows, searches |
| Browser (human-like) | 2-3 | 20-30 | 100 | Posting, replies, profile updates |
| Combined | 2 avg | 15-20 | 75 | Full engagement suite |

**Key Principle:** Randomize timing (60-90 seconds between actions) to appear human.
